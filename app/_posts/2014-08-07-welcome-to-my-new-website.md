Hey everyone. I felt it was time to get it together and relaunch my website and portfolio. 

In my new role at <a href="http://liftinteractive.com/">Lift Interactive</a>, I've had the opportunity to greatly enhance my skills and dive head first into a lot of really cool front-end tech. 

The site is built using the <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> static site generator. Jekyll is very lean when it comes to options/features, but since the templating language(Liquid) is very similar to the Django templating language that we use at Lift, I thought it would be a good fit.

One of the other really cool things that was integral in building this site was <a href="http://yeoman.io/">Yeoman</a>. Yeoman is a scaffolding tool for websites and web apps that combines <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> for running tasks, such as auto compiling your Sass files, running a local server and minifying js/css, with <a href="http://bower.io">Bower</a> for managing your dependencies and libraries. 

For this project I used a <a href="https://github.com/robwierzbowski/generator-jekyllrb">generator</a> built by Rob Wierzbowski that I had found on the Yeoman website. There were a few dependencies that I had to add, such as Foundation, but overall it fit my needs, and the development process was smooth. 

I have big plans/dreams for this blog area, so if there is any interest in my enire build process, I will write a more in-depth post that breaks all of the technology I used into something that is hopefully digestable. I hope to be back here writing soon.
